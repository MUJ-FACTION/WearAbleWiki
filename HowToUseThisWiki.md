# How to use this wiki?

I am glad you asked, meow.
To start with, here are the links:

[Github](https://github.com/MUJ-FACTION/WearAbleWiki)
[Wiki](https://arnavpraneet.github.io/WearAbleWiki)

To get started
```sh
git pull https://github.com/MUJ-FACTION/WearAbleWiki
```

Now, this wiki works on a simple MarkDown format, simply add a new document with the extension ".md" and you can document as you wish!
For help with MarkDown (it's mostly like HTML), you can refer to these links.
[MarkDown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org) and [Dilinger](https://dillinger.io).

To update the Wiki, once you are done making your changes, stage them, commit them and git push and it will update.
